                  For millions of people, running is an integral part of their life. Once you really get to experience all the benefits of running, it’s very unlikely that you will ever stop doing it. Running gives you an almost indescribable feeling of accomplishment and provides powerful relief. It helps you to clear your mind and reduces stress. As such, running is pure therapy for the soul. If there’s a problem you are struggling with, go run a mile and see what happens! While running may not help you to solve all your problems, it definitely will help you through the tough times of life. At the same time, only those who have never truly experienced the joy of running struggle to understand why running is so powerful. For many, even the thought of having to run for half an hour is quite exhausting and sickening. To them, running is not something that provides relief but it’s simply considered a punishment. Luckily, we runners know better than that. To celebrate the joy of running, we’ve created the following collection of inspiring and motivating running quotes. (You may also like our article on how to get motivated to run).
