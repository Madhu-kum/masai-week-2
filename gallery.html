        Running is enjoyed by millions of people because it's good for your body and mind and it requires very little equipment. All you need is a good pair of running shoes and the willingness to get started.

        Running may seem so simple that preparing to start a running routine may sound silly. But by learning a few basics about the sport—such as the different types of running and different gear options— you can increase your enjoyment and make your training more effective.

Whether you're brand new to running or you’re getting back to it after a long break, it's important to start out easy and build up gradually so you avoid injury. Here are some tips to get you started off on the right foot.

Wear a pair of running shoes that fit comfortably and are the right type of shoes for your foot and running style. Visit a specialty running store to get fitted for the best shoes for you.

While you are there, you might want to check out technical gear such as running shorts, tops, or tights that are made out of lightweight wicking fibers. While these garments aren't necessary for running, they help you to stay dry and comfortable when you work out.

If you’ve been sedentary for over a year, check with your doctor before you start a running program. While your doctor will most likely support a new exercise habit, he or she may offer some advice and precautions.

Also, if you've had an injury, if you take medication, or if you manage a medical condition, ask if there are special guidelines you should follow. For example, people with diabetes may want to carry a snack.3﻿ Those who take certain blood pressure medications may need to use methods other than a heart rate watch to monitor intensity.

Take measured steps to keep your body safe and free from injury. First, also do a warm up before you start running. Walk or do an easy jog for 5 to 10 minutes, before increasing your intensity. You might also add warm-up exercises such as dynamic stretches or running drills.

Then make sure you follow running safety advice, such as going against traffic when running on roads. You should also always remember to carry an ID when you head out for a run so that you can be identified quickly in the unlikely event of an accident.

        Use the Run/Walk Method

<div class="class2 class5">
        

You can start your running program by combining your runs with intervals of walking. For many new runners, this is the easiest way to build endurance with less stress on the joints and a manageable intensity level.

Simply start with one minute of running and one minute of walking, and then try to increase the running intervals. As you become more comfortable, make the switch to all running.

Your running workouts might be challenging in the beginning, but they shouldn't be so hard that you never want to run again. During each workout, keep a comfortable, conversational pace. If you can’t speak in full sentences, slow down. If you're running alone, try talking to yourself.

Breathe in through your nose and mouth so you can get the most amount of oxygen. Try doing deep belly breathing to avoid side stitches or cramps.4﻿

After each run, cool down by doing some easy jogging or walking. Some gentle stretching after will help you avoid tight muscles.

Aim for consistency in your new running program rather than speed or distance. Establish a weekly running schedule to get into a regular running habit.
